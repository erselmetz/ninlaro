                    <p class="GothamBook">Feasibility of Long-term Proteasome Inhibition in Multiple Myeloma by in-class Transition From Bortezomib to Ixazomib</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBold" >No. of Patients: <span class="GothamBook">84 patients had been treated (median age 73 years; 44% aged 75 years; 49% men; 15% Black or African American; <br>
                        and 10% Hispanic or Latino). Of the 84 patients, 62% were continuing therapy</span></p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBook"  ><span class="GothamBold">Dosage Regimen:</span> The patients receive all-oral IRd in 28-day cycles (ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1-21; <br>
                        and dexamethasone 40 mg [20 mg for patients aged > 75 years] on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) for up to 39 cycles or until PD or toxicity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBook"  ><span class="GothamBold">Treatment Period:</span> The mean duration of total PI therapy was 10.1 months and for the IRd regimen was 7.3 months</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBook"  ><span class="GothamBold">Trial Design:</span> US MM-6 is a community-based, Real-world, open-label, single arm phase IV study.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBook"  ><span class="GothamBold">Clinical Endpoints:</span> The primary endpoint is 2-year PFS (defined as the time from the first administration of IRd to the first documentation of PD or death <br>
                        from any cause). Key secondary endpoints are the response rates, duration of response, duration of therapy (IRd and ixazomib), and relative dose intensity <br>
                        for each study drug.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="GothamBook"  ><span class="GothamBold">Statistical Significance:</span> <br> With an 8-month median follow-up, the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 86% (95% confidence interval, 73%-93%) from both the start of <br>
                        bortezomib-based treatment and the start of IRd. The overall response rate was 62% (complete response, 4%; very good partial response, 25%; partial <br>
                        response, 33%) after bortezomib-based induction and 70% (complete response, 26%; very good partial response, 29%; partial response, 15%) after iCT. <br>
                        The IRd safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial data, and HRQoL and treatment satisfaction were maintained.</p>
