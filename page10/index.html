                        This was a pooled analysis of data for RRMM patients who received IRd from INSIGHTMM(NCT02761187) [8] and the Czech <br>
                        RMG. For this analysis, adult patients with RRMM, with â‰¥1 prior therapy, who had been treated with IRd, were identified. INSIGHT MM <br>
                        patients could have received IRd at any line of therapy after study entry. Patients from the two registries who received a regimen with <br>
                        an ixazomib-lenalidomide backbone therapy as index regimen were included in the analysis. INSIGHT MM patients required prospectively <br>
                        collected data on IRd therapy; patients who signed the study informed consent from more than 3 months after starting IRd were excluded <br>
                        from the analysis. RMG patients from 11 Czech centers who received IRd were included; patients who had incomplete or missing data <br>
                        were excluded. Treatment within the context of a clinical trial was permitted for Czech RMG patients.

                        Treatment effectiveness was evaluated by best response to therapy (defined as the best response recorded at any timepoint), and <br>
through assessment of DOT, time-to-next treatment (TTNT), PFS and overall survival (OS). DOT was defined as time from IRd initiation to discontinuation<br>
of therapy or death from any cause. TTNT was defined as the interval from initiation of IRd to 1 day prior to the start of a new line of therapy. PFS was<br>
defined as the time from IRd initiation to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first; OS was defined as the time from IRd initiation<br>
to death from any cause. Response and PFS were defined based on International Myeloma Working Group criteria, per the assessment of the treating<br>
physician or local investigator [19]. Time to response was defined slightly differently in the INSIGHT MM study and the Czech RMG database analysis,<br>
per individual protocols: in INSIGHT MM, it was defined as the time interval from initiation of IRd therapy to initial achievement of best response; in the<br>
analysis of the Czech RMG, it was defined as the time from initiation of IRd to first documented response of partial response (PR) or better (i.e. even if the<br>
response improved during the IRd treatment, time to response was captured as the time to first response of PR or better only). Safety was assessed by<br>
recording dose reductions and discontinuations of ixazomib or lenalidomide, and the reasons for these events during the study period.

                    <p class="GothamBold">Statistical Significance:</p>
                    <p class="GothamBook bigLineHight">At data cut-off, 263 patients from 13 countries were included. Median time from diagnosis to start of IRd was 35.8 months; median duration of follow- <br> up was 14.8 months. Overall response rate was 73%, median progression-free survival, 21.2 months and time-to-next therapy, 33.0 months. Ixazomib/ <br> 
                        lenalidomide dose reductions were required in 17%/36% of patients; 32%/30% of patients discontinued ixazomib/lenalidomide due to adverse events.</p>
