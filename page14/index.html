                        The primary outcome of interest was TTNT. TTNT (a surrogate measure for PFS in Real-world analyses) was defined as the time from
                        the start of the index LOT to initiation of the subsequent line of therapy or death, whichever occurred earlier. Patients were censored if they did not
                        have an event (start of next LOT/death) by the end of study period or date of last EHR activity. We also evaluated duration of therapy (DOT) of the index
                        regimen, which was defined as the time from initiation of the first drug in the index regimen to discontinuation of the last drug in the regimen plus a
                        run-out period or death, whichever occurred earlier. The DOT of the individual agents (i.e. the PI component and lenalidomide) within the index LOT was
                        also evaluated utilizing the initiation date of the agent and the last date administered for the agent plus the run-out period or death. The run-out date for
                        infused/injected drugs was the latest date of administration +30 days; for orally administered drugs, it was the fill date + (days’ supply −1).

                    <p class="GothamBook pe-5"><span class="GothamBold">Statistical Significance:</span> <br> Risk of PI-triplet discontinuation was lower for I- vs. K-Rd (HR: 0.71) and I- vs. V-Rd (HR: 0.85); unadjusted, median TTNTs (months): 12.7/8.6/14.2 (LOT ≥2) and 16.8/9.5/14.6 (LOT 2–3) (I-/K-/V-Rd). Adjusted TTNT was comparable between I-/K-/V-Rd in LOT ≥2 with a TTNT benefit among intermediate/frail patients for I- (HR: 0.70; P=0.04) and V- (HR: 0.73; P < 0.05) vs. K-Rd. I/K/V-Rd triplets were comparable in TTNT overall, but IRd and VRd were associated with longer TTNT in intermediate/frail patients than KRd.</p>
